I&amp;rsquo;m currently pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science at Brown University and while I was applying to all these various grad school programs there was a constant frustration (maybe &amp;lsquo;frustration&amp;rsquo; is too heavy a word, but I guess you get my point) on what all things I could have done better during my undergrad along with the sporadic moments of relief thinking about things I did right.</description></item></channel></rss>
