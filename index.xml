I&amp;rsquo;m currently pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science at Brown University and while I was applying to all these various grad school programs there was a constant frustration (maybe &amp;lsquo;frustration&amp;rsquo; is too heavy a word, but I guess you get my point) on what all things I could have done better during my undergrad along with the sporadic moments of relief thinking about things I did right.</description></item><item><title>Finally done with the GRE.

Didn&amp;rsquo;t do too shabby, scored:
169 Quant :) 160 Verbal :/ 3.5AWA :( A little context, I&amp;rsquo;m a non-native English speaker and would be applying for MS in CS programs. Also, I prepared for 6 months along with a 40hrs per week internship, though the pandemic lockdown helped me focus pretty much completely on GRE for the last month.
