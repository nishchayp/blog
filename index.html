This is just some advice from a current grad school student on what you should work on and (more importantly) what you should not work on during your undergrad years if grad school is your aim. I&rsquo;m currently pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science at Brown University and while I was applying to all these various grad school programs there was a constant frustration (maybe &lsquo;frustration&rsquo; is too heavy a word, but I guess you get my point) on what all things I could have done better during my undergrad along with the sporadic moments of relief thinking about things I did right.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/posts/grad_school_admission/advice_to_ugs/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://nishchayp.github.io/blog/posts/projects-readme/fifawc/>fifawc - CLI app to track FIFA World Cup 2018</a></h1><time datetime=2019-02-10T21:07:55+0530 class=post-date>Sun, Feb 10, 2019</time>

Explaination of the three states As teams get bigger and projects more complex there arises a need for tools which can keep track of all the changes made to the project by each team member, allow each member to work on their copies of the project simultaneously without breaking the project for each other, help collaborate and combine the changes made by different members, rollback certain changes and a whole lot more, all for the sake of efficient workflow of the project and effective collaboration between team members.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/posts/tech/git-state-of-mystery/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://nishchayp.github.io/blog/posts/books/catcher-in-the-rye/>Book Review: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger</a></h1><time datetime=2016-06-02T20:39:57+0530 class=post-date>Thu, Jun 2, 2016</time>
The Catcher in the Rye is not a book meant to be liked or criticized by the readers because the author writes down a part of his own heart and mind and thus it seems evident that just like &lsquo;Holden Caulfield&rsquo; even J.D. Salinger cared the least about the opinion of the society he was a part of. The book converses with you on a personal level in a way unlike any other book, person or even your own conscious.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/posts/books/catcher-in-the-rye/>Read More…</a></div></article></div></main></body></html>
