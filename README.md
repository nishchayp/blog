# Ramble On - Blog by Nishchay
Blogging site for me (Nishchay Parashar). Is live on https://nishchayp.github.io/blog/

## Adding new blog
Use `hugo` to add new blogs by using the cmd `hugo new posts/foo.md` or simply use an existing blog as template and add it to the `/content/posts/` directory.

## Publishing the site
Just push to the `main` branch. A github workflow is set to build and publish it to `gh-pages` branch which is being served by GitHub pages.

## TODO
- [ ] Favicon
- [ ] Clicable tags on each blog
- [ ] Write more blogs
